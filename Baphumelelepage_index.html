			     <p>Hello to Everyone,</p>

<p>We, Hendrik, Dilay, Klara and Feline, started our voluntary work for one year in South Africa in the organization Baphumelele
&ldquo;Children`s Home&ldquo; and &ldquo;Fountain of Hope&ldquo;.</p>

<p>Baphumelele was founded in the year of 2001 and has since then grown into a lot of different projects. The main project is the &ldquo;Children`s Home&ldquo;. 
This is an orphanage in the township Khayeitsha, whose vision is to provide a temporary shelter for Children who are orphans or who can`t live in their homes anymore for different
 reasons. Some of them are HIV infected or traumatized by their past. At the moment, we have around 100 Kids between 0-18 living in 11 clusters plus a Baby Bouse for the Babies.
 The clusters are separated by age and gender, and they have house mothers we call Sisi, which means Sister in Xhosa.
Other parts  of Baphumelele is the Clemens House, the Respite Care Center and a Preschool. The Clemens House 
is a place for sick children to come, not only for the kids from the Children`s Home, but also for kids from Khayelitsha.
 The Respite Care Center is a place to recover and get the needed medication for adults with HIV and/or TB infections. We are
 working in all of these facilities and try to give them as much attention as possible.</p>

<p>The subsidiary &ldquo;Fountain of Hope&ldquo; is the continuous program for the Youth who are 18 and older. This project exists because
 of the &ldquo;Child Care Act&ldquo; that makes it impossible for the Children to stay any longer in the Children Homes because they are  
 considered adults, and in this way Baphumelele can keep the Youth off the streets and out of the gangs. &ldquo;Fountain of Hope`s&ldquo;
 goal is to keep them in school for another year and get them jobs for their futures. They are living on a farm that grows organic 
 vegetables and partly working there too. They have to cook and clean by themselves and learn during a program all the important 
 things to live an independent live.</p>
<p>Having said this, there are still a lot of things missing in these projects, and because of that they`re all looking for funding in form of donations. We, as in the volunteers,
 are planing to do things like outings with the Children/Youth to the beach, the museum, or maybe even teach them different kinds of sports. Moreover there`s a lot of rooms 
 which still need renovation.
They are also missing everyday supplies like toothbrushes, shoes, toys, beds, and other smaller things.</p>
<p>This is the reason why we opened a fund for the Kids/Youth, to make those things possible and help them wherever we can.
 &ldquo;Ukwabelana luthando&ldquo; means in Xhosa something like &ldquo;share with love&ldquo;, so 
 we would appreciate it, if a lot of people would take part and donate even just a little bit into the fund.</p>
<p>In this Blog we will keep you up to date with our Program, Outings, and Projects, so you can see what your money goes into.
 We are also going to post Upcoming Projects and if you are interested in continuously sponsoring, you can also choose specific Projects to support.
We are pleased about every kind of donation because even small amounts can make a huge difference!</p>
<h2>Enkosi Kahkulu </h2>
<p>Thank You very much!</p>

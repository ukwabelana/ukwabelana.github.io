			     <h2> Outings</h2>
				 


<p>The Kids in the Children`s Home, as well as the Youth from the Farm, don`t have a lot of possibilities to get out of their homes. 
After they come back from school they have to stay here in the Children`s Home, and or sometimes they are allowed to go to the shop on the next 
corner if they have the money for it. As you can imagine, it gets very boring quickly for them to stay at the same place the whole time, even when
 we try to do some programs with them in the afternoon.</p>
<p>For this reason, we are planning to do some Outings with them, especially in view of the upcoming Christmas Holidays. We thought about going to the beach
 and organizing some surf lessons for them. Also we want to go hiking or maybe do something exciting like ice skating or rock climbing. There are a lot 
 of preparations going into all this.</p>
<p>First of all, we have to decide what we are able to do with specific clusters. Then we have to book some of these activities and also need to organize 
transportation for everyone. We also need to get food for the day and maybe swimsuits or caps for hot days. </p>
<p>The plannings are just in the beginning stages and before we can continue we need to get an overview about the budget we may have. </p>

Upcoming 


In the beginning we said that we want to give you the possibility to choose the Projects you want to support if you want to support us. 
If there is one specific one you are especially interested in, you can support that or donate in general and we take it for whatever we need it at the moment.
With &ldquo;Upcoming&ldquo; we mean our ideas about Projects for and with the Kids we are planning or want to plan. 
Whenever we are planing to do something, we want to post it here and hope for your support, before we continue to develop the idea.
Most of the Projects that we want to do depend on the donations we are able to get. 
But not every Upcoming is a big Project. Sometimes we just need smaller things or one time donations for specific things for Kids. Anything helps!

			     <h3> Cooking actually started with Baking.</h3>

<p> 
The organization we came with is not the only organization that is sending volunteers to Baphumelele, but we are the only ones who are staying for one year. 
The others usually come for a couple weeks or months. Luckily a new volunteer arrived a few days after us who is supposed to stay until December. 
She was the one who came up with the idea to Bake cinnamon roles with the Kids.
 Pretty sure that she did it with the motivation to eat an &ldquo;extra snack&ldquo;, we helped her... </p>

			     <h3> As known as: Toothbrushing </h3>

<p> As I started my Volunteering work in September I was first a little bit stuck, everything was different, as expected, but also not.
 I was overwhelmed by how excited the kids were to meet someone new and how warmly everybody welcomed me. But also as the new one, I first had to find my place
 in the Project and my own duties.
 That wasn`t as easy as expected because Khayelitscha is a Xhosa speaking Township..</p>

			     <h3> Recycle, rebuild and reuse</h3>

<p> Compared to the Childrens home, the farm is a new project. It is still beginning and is about to grow a lot. 
Some of the buildings aren`t finished yet, and because of that there is a lot of improvising with container or shack buildings. 
Some of the rooms inside the buildings remind me of the &ldquo;Room of Requirements&ldquo;, where generation after generation had tried 
to hide old, broken and stuff that is not useful. The rooms are filled up to the top with old beds, tables, and closets, and chairs pilling on the side, 
leaving barely any room to work around.
 Obviously Africans aren`t good at throwing broken and old stuff away, because they think there could always be another use for it...</p>

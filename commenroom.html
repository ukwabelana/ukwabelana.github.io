<p>Compared to the Childrens home, the farm is a new project. It is still beginning and is about to grow a lot. 
Some of the buildings aren`t finished yet, and because of that there is a lot of improvising with container or shack buildings. 
Some of the rooms inside the buildings remind me of the &ldquo;Room of Requirements&ldquo;, where generation after generation had tried to hide old, 
broken and stuff that is not useful. The rooms are filled up to the top with old beds, tables, and closets, and chairs pilling on the side, 
leaving barely any room to work around. Obviously Africans aren`t good at throwing broken and old stuff away, because they think there could
 always be another use for it.. </p>
<p>The Youth are also using one of the storage rooms as their Common Room because of a broken sofa they use to hang out on, but it`s not really 
a comfortable place. This is why we decided to make that room our first Project together with the Youth. 
We started to throw all the old and unneeded stuff away and kept the stuff we still can use to make that room a real Common Room. While we were 
doing this, we found an old Pool Table and a broken ping pong plate, which just needed to be fixed. So the next two projects were born.</p>

<p>We started with the Pool table. Having only our own money, and therefore a small budget, we needed to come up with creative ideas for the fabric 
and the plate. It ended up that we bought bed sheets and nails to put in an old wooden board. 
The ping pong plate was also fixed in one day. We just needed to screw the legs and the plate down together and stretch a new net across to make 
it playable again. After, we also found some old Pool balls and bought a new Pool stick. To play ping pong, we found one old ping pong bat and a
 wooden piece which we could use for it. After both projects were  finished, we could finally play our first tournament; 
perfect timing for two of the Youth who had birthdays that week and could have their first Birthday Party!</p>

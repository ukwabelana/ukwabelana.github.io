			     <h1>Also known as: Toothbrushing </h1>

<p>As I started my Volunteering work in September I was first a little bit stuck, everything was different, as expected, but also not.
 I was overwhelmed by how excited the Kids were to meet someone new and how warmly everybody welcomed me. But also as the new one,
 I first had to find my place in the Project and my own duties. That wasn`t as easy as expected because Khayelitscha is a Xhosa speaking Township 
 and my co worker, the caretakers of the Children speak in Xhosa which each other and some of them speak a worse English than I do. </p>
 <p>During my second week, I met another volunteer from Germany who had been here for two months and she told me that she started to brush
 the teeth of the Babies in the Baby House because it seemed like nobody did it with them before, or at least not everyday.
 
 She asked me to join and continue when she left. Happy and excited to found a project to start with, I followed her and together we also
 went to the clusters of the younger children from 5 to 9 to see if and how they were brushing their teeth. We were shocked as we realized
 that they first had to search for their brushes in their shelves and under the bed, and that not even all of them had their own one..</p>
 
 <p>As soon as I could, I drove to the mall and bought new brushes for everyone, and together with their caretakers we wrote their names on them. 
 They were really excited to get something to have for themselves. After everyone got a toothbrush, I started a brushing routine with them every 
 evening after supper around 6pm. The first few times were really tough! Every time I came to help them, they were so excited to use their own 
 brushes that they would run around and get crazy. Sometimes it took a really long time to finish brushing with everyone because I had to brush
 some of their teeth until they learned how to do it themselves. I also had to learn a lot, for example, that I couldn`t give them the toothpaste
 to put on the brush alone and also that I couldn`t leave them in the bathroom alone otherwise they made a mess. </p>
 
<p>Finally they learned it and got used to it the Kids as well as the caretakers. Now every time I come in the evening, they know what to do and how to do it. 
When they are finished, we also have these little contests of who brushed the best. 
I already don`t have to come to the older clusters everyday to brush with them because they do it alone ore with the caretakers.
 This is making me really proud of them and also gives me the feeling that I made an impact. </p>

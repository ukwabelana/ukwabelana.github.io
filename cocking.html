			     <h1>Cooking actually started with Baking.</h1>

<p> 
The organization we came with is not the only organization that is sending volunteers to Baphumelele,
 but we are the only ones who are staying for one year. The others usually come for a couple weeks or months.
 Luckily a new volunteer arrived a few days after us who is supposed to stay until December. 
 She was the one who came up with the idea to Bake cinnamon roles with the Kids. Pretty sure 
 that she did it with the motivation to eat an &ldquo;extra snack&ldquo;, we helped her. First, we had to 
 prepare a recipe and buy all the needed ingredients. After that we had to prepare all the ingredients
 every time for every cluster before we could start. Together with the Kids we put everything together
 and mixed it up before they could role the dough into the small roles with cinnamon. Waiting in front 
 of the oven until they were ready was definitely the worst part. Besides that, all of the Kids and even
 the Sisis had a lot of fun and enjoyed the baking time. 
After we did it with the first cluster and everybody smelled the incredibly good smell of fresh baked 
cinnamon roles, all of them couldn`t wait to be next. </p>

<p>Baking went so well that we decided to also try Cooking. This time, we let the Kids choose what they wanted
 to cook and every cluster decided to do hamburgers. This is something quite easy to make with many Kids
 because we just needed to prepare the vegetables and the meat, and they could take everything they wanted 
 and put it together. I think for every cluster this is definitely the highlight of their week. </p>

<p>We would like to continue the cooking and baking with the Kids, not only because they enjoyed it so much,
 but also because otherwise they only get the same few meals again and again. 
Because Baphumelele can`t afford to buy special food for every time we want to cook something different 
with the Kids, we need to buy it by ourselves. </p>

<p>If you are interested in supporting this project with even a small donation, so we can afford the ingredients
 for cooking with the Kids, you are very welcome!! It`s a really easy way to put a big smile on the Kid`s faces! </p>

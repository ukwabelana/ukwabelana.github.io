			     <p>The organization we came with is not the only organization that is sending volunteers to Baphumelele, 
but we are the only ones who are staying for one year. The others usually come for a couple weeks or months. 
Luckily a new volunteer arrived a few days after us who is supposed to stay until December.
 She was the one who came up with the idea to Bake cinnamon roles with the Kids. 
 Pretty sure that she did it with the motivation to eat an “extra snack”, we helped her.
 First, we had to prepare a recipe and buy all the needed ingredients.</p>

			     <p>The Farm is compared to the Childrens home a new project. It still in the beginning and is about to grow a lot.
 Some of the buildings aren´t finished jet and because of that there is a lot improvised with container or shack buildings. 
Some of the rooms inside the buildings reminded me of the Room of Requirements where generation after generation had 
tried to hid old broken and unusefull stuff. They are fild up to the top whit old beds, tables and closeds, 
chairs pilling on the side leaving berlie room to work around. Obvesiously africans aren´t good in throwing 
broken and old stuff away because there could always be another use for it.. 
The Youth is also using one of the storage roomes as there common room... </p>

			      <p>As I started my Volunteering work in September I was first a little bit stuck, everything was different, as expected, but also not.
 I was overwhelmed by how excited the kids were to meet someone new and how warmly everybody welcomed me. But also as the new one, I first had to find my place in the Project and my own duties.
 That wasn´t as easy as expected because Khayelitscha is a Xhosa speaking Township</p>
